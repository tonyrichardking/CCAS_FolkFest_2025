I'm three tunes in - how about the GFED baseline for the Lisganon? GECD has been used a few times now. 
Also any chance of indicating a busier rhythm anywhere?

I wanna: nice to have the saxes starting this. I stay on D more to start 
- D D DG D, G G/Emin A A, D D GA D, D D GA D. Will we do A major for the 7th time? Nice or hackneyed?

Think Tralee Geol should start with 3 bars of Amin, then G

A few notes in the melody of the bridge of Athlone that aren't quite the same as the way I know them

Can you make the two marches slower?

FREAKY chord on the end! But not necessarily in a bad way.

Can we have some times around the tunes with 1 baseline instrument to allow for more variety? 
And have the upper horns play the tune sometimes?

Also I hope our lower horn player is not that sustained! But good job Tony! You've done loads to put 
this together!
